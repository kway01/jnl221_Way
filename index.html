		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Drones dropped in Pakistan, Pitch Interactive</h3>
		<p>This project uses data from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and uses a timeline and a bar chart as dataviz elements. The timeline displays drone strikes in Pakistan from 2004 until 2015 and it demonstrates the steep increase in drone strikes in recent years. Furthermore, the bar chart uses stick figures to exhibit the amount of people in Pakistan that have died as a result of drone strikes each month. The main message of this project is to elucidate the quantity of drone strikes in Pakistan in recent years. This project also attempts to highlight how these drone strikes tend to have a significant effect on civilians. </p>
		<p>This project is highly effective at conveying the intended message through dataviz. Firstly, the timeline used lines projecting downwards to personify a drone strike, successfully mimicking each individual done strike. This allows the viewer to visualize each observation in the dataset as an actual drone strike, rather than just viewing a number on a screen. Secondly, the bar chart uses stick figures to show the amount of deaths as a result of drone strikes. This allows the reader to associate the data with actual people, once again humanizing the dataset.</p>
		<p>Moreover, this data is definitely visceral, as Mona Chalabi would say, or in other words, creates powerful internal feelings within the viewer. This is executed by using lines projecting downwards to represent drone strikes, and stick figures to represent people. The color scheme in this project also adds to the emotional connection, as the colors black and red create a gloomy and tragic feel. It is hard for humans to conceptualize straight numbers, but this project turned the numbers into illustrations of drone strikes in Pakistan which made the dataviz visceral and gave viewers an emotional connection.</p>



		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

	<iframe title="Amount of Troops the U.S. Deployed Overseas in 2020" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-Oa2ID" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Oa2ID/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="391"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
